        <div class="introtext"><p>Having had a passion for IT since a very young age, I have developed solid expertise in web design and project management. With a wide range of professional experience, 
          I have acquired skills in communication, development and management, which enable me to combine a creative vision with a pragmatic approach. 
          My future goal is to become a great Python developer.
